### Predicting Cyber Threat Severity using NLP

With cyberattacks growing more prevalent and damaging globally, cybersecurity engineers urgently need ways to prioritize efforts in securing vulnerable systems. Cybersecurity engineers rely heavily on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) data, which documents known vulnerabilities. CVEs are assigned Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity scores by experts to indicate priority levels. However, nearly half of CVE records lack CVSS scores, limiting their utility. This project aims to develop a natural language processing system using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to analyze the text descriptions of CVEs and accurately predict CVSS scores. By training BERT models on the technical cybersecurity terminology in these descriptions, the system can learn to map patterns in the text to severity ratings like those in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). We plan to train Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) on the text descriptions of CVEs with known CVSS scores. Separate BERT classifiers will be developed to analyze the description text and predict each CVSS metric like attack vector and complexity etc. By combining the metric predictions, the models will generate an overall base CVSS score for new CVEs. Success will be evaluated by comparing predicted scores to human-labeled scores using metrics including mean squared error, R-squared, and accuracy for security severity label. We envision delivering an intuitive application that allows engineers to get CVSS predictions by uploading CVE descriptions. The system will enable engineers to prioritize undiscovered vulnerabilities, allowing them to better defend against emerging cyberthreats.
